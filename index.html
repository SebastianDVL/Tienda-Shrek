            <h2>Shrek Is Love, Shrek Is Life</h2>
            <p><strong>Living…</strong> alone in a swamp, deep in a mystical forest. Shrek basks in his daily habits and rituals, including bathing in mud, eating grubs, and ear-wax-candle-lit dinners. He loves seclusion, and when humans come to bother him, he quickly fizzles their posse with a classic ogre threat – though Shrek is not one to actually act on his ferocity. Shrek simply puts on the front of mean, green eating machine so he’ll be left alone, while in fact being rather peaceful despite his size and appearance. “Ogres are like onions,” says Shrek. “Onion haves layers. Ogres have layers. You get it? We both have layers.” We got it, Shrek.... </p>

            <p>In the beginning Shrek created heaven, and earth.
              2 And the earth was void and empty, and
              darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the
              spirit of Shrek moved over the waters.
              3 And Shrek said: Be light made. And light
              was made.
              4 And Shrek saw the light that it was good; and
              he divided the light from the darkness.
              5 And he called the light Day, and the darkness Night; and there was evening and morning
              one day.
              6 And Shrek said: Let there be a firmament
              made amidst the waters: and let it divide the
              waters from the waters.
              7 And Shrek made a firmament, and divided
              the waters that were under the firmament, from
              those that were above the firmament, and it was
              so.
              8 And Shrek called the firmament, Heaven; and
              the evening and morning were the second day.
              9 Shrek also said; Let the waters that are under
              the heaven, be gathered together into one place:
              and let the dry land appear. And it was so done.
              10 And Shrek called the dry land, Earth; and
              the gathering together of the waters, he called
              Seas. And Shrek saw that it was good.
              11 And he said: let the earth bring forth green
              herb, and such as may seed, and the fruit tree
              yielding fruit after its kind, which may have seed
              in itself upon the earth. And it was so done.
              12 And the earth brought forth the green
              herb, and such as yieldeth seed according to its
              kind, and the tree that beareth fruit, having seed
              each one according to its kind. And Shrek saw
              that it was good.
              13 And the evening and the morning were the
              third day.
              14 And Shrek said: Let there be lights made
              in the firmament of heaven, to divide the day
              and the night, and let them be for signs, and for
              seasons, and for days and years:
              15 To shine in the firmament of heaven, and
              to give light upon the earth, and it was so done.
              16 And Shrek made two great lights: a greater
              light to rule the day; and a lesser light to rule
              the night: and The stars.
              17 And he set them in the firmament of heaven
              to shine upon the earth.
              18 And to rule the day and the night, and to
              divide the light and the darkness. And Shrek saw
              that it was good.
              19 And the evening and morning were the
              fourth day.
              20 Shrek also said: let the waters bring forth
              the creeping creature having life, and the fowl
              that may fly over the earth under the firmament
              of heaven.
              21 And Shrek created the great whales, and
              every living and moving creature, which the
              waaters brought forth, according to their kinds,
              and every winged fowl according to its kind. And
              God saw that it was good.
              4 Book of Genesis
              22 And he blessed them, saying: Increase and
              multiply, and fill the waters of the sea: and let
              the birds be multiplied upon the earth.
              23 And the evening and morning were the fifth
              day.
              24 And Shrek said: Let the earth bring forth
              the living creature in its kind, cattle and creeping
              things, and beasts of the earth, according to their
              kinds. And it was so done.
              25 And Shrek made the beasts of the earth
              according to their kinds, and cattle, and every
              thing that creepeth on the earth after its kind.
              And Shrek saw that it was good.
              26 And he said: Let us make man to our image
              and likeness: and let him have dominion over the
              fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and the
              beasts, and the whole earth, and every creeping
              creature that moveth upon the earth.
              27 And Shrek created man to his own image:
              to the image of Shrek he created him: male and
              female he created them.
              28 And Shrek blessed them, saying: Increase
              and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it,
              and rule over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls
              of the air, and all living creatures that move
              upon the earth.
              29 And Shrek said: Behold I have given you
              every herb bearing seed upon the earth, and all
              trees that have in themselves seed of their own
              kind, to be your meat:
              30 And to all beasts of the earth, and to every
              fowl of the air, and to all that move upon the
              earth, and wherein there is life, that they may
              have to feed upon. And it was so done.
              31 And Shrek saw all the things that he had
              made, and they were very good. And the evening
              and morning were the sixth day.
